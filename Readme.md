# Youtube Playlist Details

## Deprecated

This repo was created to host the project which was created ~2017 but is not maintained and will no longer be worked on.

## About

This project was created due to youtube not showing the total length of all the videos in a playlist.

It allows users to enter the url of a Youtube Playlist and view the total length of the playlsit - along with other basic info about the playlist and each individual playlist.

## API Key 

The API Key used for the Youtube Data calls is a public one but restricted so cannot be used elsewhere, therefore to get this project working locally or on your own server, a Youtube Data v3 API key will be needed and updated in `/js/api-credentials.js` -> `getApiKey()`.

**Note: This is not the best approach and would not be how I'd implement it today.**
